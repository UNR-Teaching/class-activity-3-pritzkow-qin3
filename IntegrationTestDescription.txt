We chose to do a Top Down Integration Test for our TicTacToe program. We thought that with our program design and structure, this would be the most beneficial integration test style to use. When modifying our code from last week to be more object oriented, we prioritized separating functions solely on their functionality and a little bit on their relationships with other classes. Because of this, integration testing was vital to us. We started by testing our driver, which contained a playGame() function which made everything go. After running multiple tests, we determined that this was the file that caused most of our problems, and required us to rework it a bit.
